# Under Construction! ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

ðŸš¨ Proceed with Caution ðŸš¨

Somehow you've landed on, what I think, is a pretty cool boilerplate for a web/mobile app built using React/React Native. This is very much in still a WIP, but is built with stability and industry best practices in mind. I hope to use this as a template for future projects, and I expect to have branches with experimental features, in order to keep main stable for the future. If you are an individual, please feel free to use this, but I maintain no responsibility for what may go wrong ðŸ¤£

## What's it got?

React, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Websockets, Simple user AUTH, Redux, React Router, React Query, React Icons, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, NGINX, based of CRA

## Coming Soon!

React Hook Form, Playwright, Storybook, Dark Mode, ...some cool graphing library ðŸ¤”

## Current Pages

- Static landing
- Static About Me
- Barebones Chat App using Websocket with Express/Mongo backend
- Todo List integrated with same Express backend (currently hooked up to atlas, if you found this somehow please dont abuse it!!! (ya its open, cuz im nice, but getting your own is free!)) 

## Pages To Be Added

- Interactive informational node web
- Some cool graphs! (it's been tooo long ðŸ˜­)
- Maybe a sample checkers(/chess if ambition hits ðŸ˜…) 
- Maybe the basis for a in-browser rpg that will spin off into it's own application (Dear Glitch creators aka Slack boys, i think you have money for server space now and i miss milking butterflies ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¥²)

## Current Experimental Features

- None ðŸ˜­

## Potential Future ExpFeat

- Apple Vision Pro Mixed space 
- React Strict DOM (Tailwind)
An experimental feature from Meta enabling a standardization of components across different platforms, i.e. React, React Native, React VisionOS, React VR

## How to Run
In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run eject` (applicable only to forked projects ðŸ˜‰)

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you canâ€™t go back!**

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point youâ€™re on your own.

You donâ€™t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldnâ€™t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldnâ€™t be useful if you couldnâ€™t customize it when you are ready for it.
