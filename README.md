# Under Construction! ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§

ðŸš¨ Proceed with Caution ðŸš¨

Somehow you've landed on, what I think, is a pretty cool boilerplate for a web/mobile app built using React/React Native. This is very much in still a WIP, but is built with stability and industry best practices in mind. I hope to use this as a template for future projects, and I expect to have branches with experimental features, in order to keep main stable for the future. If you are an individual, please feel free to use this, but I maintain no responsibility for what may go wrong ðŸ¤£

## What's it got?

React, React Native, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Websockets, Simple user AUTH, Redux, React Router, React Query, React Icons, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, NGINX, based of CRA

## Coming Soon!

React Hook Form, Playwright, Storybook, Dark Mode, ...some cool graphing library ðŸ¤”

## Current Pages

- Static landing
- Static About Me
- Barebones Chat App using Websocket with Express/Mongo backend
- Todo List integrated with same Express backend (currently hooked up to atlas, if you found this somehow please dont abuse it!!! (ya its open, cuz im nice, but getting your own is free!)) 

## Pages To Be Added

- Interactive informational node web
- Some cool graphs! (it's been tooo long ðŸ˜­)
- Maybe a sample checkers(/chess if ambition hits ðŸ˜…) 
- Maybe the basis for a in-browser rpg that will spin off into it's own application (Dear Glitch creators aka Slack boys, i think you have money for server space now and i miss milking butterflies ðŸ¦‹ðŸ¥²)

## Current Experimental Features

- None ðŸ˜­

## Potential Future ExpFeat

- Apple Vision Pro Mixed space 
- React Strict DOM (Tailwind)
An experimental feature from Meta enabling a standardization of components across different platforms, i.e. React, React Native, React VisionOS, React VR

# How to Run
This application was bootstrapped from Create React App. If having any issues, or unsure about anything in this section, that will likely be a great resource.

## Web:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode. (Hot Module enabled ðŸ”¥)\
[By Default] Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

This is currently being used by Docker and set up for hosting on Azure.

## Mobile:
### `yarn run mobile`

Runs the app in expo. This provides a QR code for viewing on actual devices, or hotkeys for opening various simulators/environments.
Enjoy ðŸ˜Ž

### `yarn run [android|ios|web]`

Opens the app in expo with the selected simulator set to auto-open
Enjoy, but lazier ðŸ¥³
